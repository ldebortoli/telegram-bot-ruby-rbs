## Persistent project memory

Before project work, read in order: `.codex/CONTEXT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `USER_QUEUE.md` and `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`. Process new user queue items into the backlog without duplicates. Update memory during work and commit/push it with project changes when a remote is configured.
<!-- codex-user-queue-execution -->
## Automatic user queue execution

`Procesadas` in `.codex/USER_QUEUE.md` means incorporated into `BACKLOG.md`, not completed. After handling the direct message that starts a run, automatically execute every unblocked queue-derived backlog task by priority. Continue until each is implemented, validated and moved to `DONE`, or record its precise blocker and continue with other executable queued work. Do not stop after triage or after only one queued task unless the user explicitly asks to pause, stop or only report status.

Never leave a queue-derived request as an unqualified `TODO`, `P1` or `P2` item. Its own backlog line must be in `IN PROGRESS`, in `DONE`, or include `[BLOCKED: exact reason]` beside the task name. Before ending a run, audit every processed queue item against those states. If quota ends mid-task, preserve it in `IN PROGRESS` and record the exact continuation step in `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.
